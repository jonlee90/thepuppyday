## Kiro SDD Workflow

This project uses Kiro Spec-Driven Development. For each phase:

1. **Requirements**: Create `docs/specs/{phase}/requirements.md` (EARS format)
2. **Design**: Create `docs/specs/{phase}/design.md` (architecture, data models)
3. **Tasks**: Create `docs/specs/{phase}/tasks.md` (implementation checklist)
4. **Implement**: Use `/kc:impl [task-number]` command
